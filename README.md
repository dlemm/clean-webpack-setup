# clean-webpack-setup
This is my first public repro and my first selfmade clean webpack 4 starter setup, too.
I am going to use this as a starting point for future projects.

## Setup

node: v8.9.1,
npm: 6.1.0,
webpack 4.12.0
I do also use a content.json and twig-files with a main template.



It's recommended that you use **N**ode **V**ersion **M**anager to install and manage Node versions.

    $ nvm install && nvm use
    $ npm install


### Development

Starting development-server:

    $ npm run dev

### Production

Building a dist folder:

    $ npm run build
